Goal: Build and maintain a production-grade blackjack live counting + guidance tool specifically for MyBookie.ag live blackjack sessions.

Core Requirements
1) Ruleset fidelity:
   - 6 decks
   - Dealer hits soft 17 (H17)
   - Double after split (DAS)
   - No surrender
   - Split limit 1
   - Split aces receive one card only
2) Real-time counting:
   - Running count (RC), true count (TC), decks remaining estimate (auto by cards dealt and optional manual override)
   - Edge estimate and conservative bet suggestion (units) based on TC
3) Player guidance:
   - Always-visible “Recommended Move” based on the above ruleset
   - Must support pair detection and split logic, and full soft totals (A2–A9) and DAS-aware doubles
   - Inputs include Player cards, Dealer cards (upcard), and Table cards (other seen cards), all counted into RC/TC
4) Input UX:
   - Keyboard-driven and touch-driven
   - Touch keypad laid out like a phone pad
   - Tens entered as 'T' (and J/Q/K map to T)
   - Debounce taps to prevent double-entry
   - Undo, Next Hand (clears hands only, keeps count), Reset Shoe (clears count + hands), and Target cycling (Player/Dealer/Table)
5) UI/UX:
   - Minimal, clean, dark, “sticky” and engaging
   - Recommendation must be visually dominant and never hidden behind drawers/overlays
   - Settings drawer must open/close reliably, and Apply/Reset must work
6) Deployment:
   - Static deployment on Vercel
   - No broken IDs between HTML/CSS/JS

Deliverables
- Update index.html, style.css, app.js, and engine.js in sync.
- Ensure zero console errors and all controls work.
- Add an iOS wrapper:
   - Provide a SwiftUI WKWebView wrapper that loads the deployed Vercel URL (or local index.html)
   - Include minimal navigation, persistent screen-on option guidance, and safe settings for a training utility.

Testing Checklist
- Enter Player(2) + Dealer(1) and confirm a recommended move appears.
- Add Table cards and confirm RC/TC/Edge/Bet update.
- Next Hand clears hands, keeps counts.
- Reset Shoe clears everything.
- Settings drawer opens, closes, applies, and persists to localStorage.
- Tap debounce prevents double entries.
