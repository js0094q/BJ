script = "Develop a web app tool for blackjack players to count cards, adhering to mybookie.ag live blackjack rules: using 6 decks, hitting on soft 16, and allowing split aces to receive only one card. The tool should update the deck count in real-time and provide practice hits that simulate these rules. The user interface will be keyboard-driven, with outputs displayed in real-time to improve player skills. Ensure the app supports multiple output formats, including text, tables, and simulations. Carefully test to confirm rule accuracy and smooth user experience. The files inside this project are the latest iteration and works exceptionally well.
